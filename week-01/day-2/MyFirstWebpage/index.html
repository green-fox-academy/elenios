                <h2>Fullstack software developer</h2>
                <p>I love to design complex systems with high levels of automation including 
                AI and robotics. I'm deeply interested in inventing new things that can 
                augment the human experience.<br><br>
                Everything I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll ever do, 
                I do to protect this world. Someone once told me that with great power 
                comes great respontibility.</p>

                <h3>Logic Gate</h3>
                <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; 
                that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs 
                and produces a single binary output.</p>
                <h3>ASCII</h3>
                <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
                Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of 
                a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
                <h3>RAM</h3>
                <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program 
                instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. 
                Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of 
                the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
                <h3>BASIC</h3>
                <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to 
                produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for 
                a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
                <h3>DNS</h3>
                <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or 
                other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates 
                various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>
                <h3>HTTP</h3>
                <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia 
                information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. 
                It is the standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
